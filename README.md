Project Summary:
This project involves creating a program for the Corner Grocer to analyze text records of items purchased throughout the day. The program needs to calculate the frequency of each item, provide options to display the frequencies, generate a histogram, and save the data to a backup file.

Problem Solving:
The program addresses the Corner Grocer's need to rearrange its produce section effectively by analyzing the frequency of items purchased. By providing insights into the most frequently purchased items, the program assists in optimizing the layout of the store, improving customer experience, and potentially increasing sales.

Strengths:

Modularity: The code is organized into a class structure, making it modular and easier to maintain.
Input Validation: The program includes input validation to handle invalid user choices, enhancing robustness.
Error Handling: Error messages are displayed when file operations fail, improving user experience.
Readability: Meaningful variable names, comments, and a clear structure enhance code readability.
Areas for Enhancement:

Error Handling Improvement: Enhance error handling to provide more detailed error messages, aiding in debugging and troubleshooting.
Optimization: Implement optimizations such as using iterators instead of range-based loops for large datasets to improve efficiency.
Security: Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input sanitization, to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
Challenges:

Histogram Generation: Implementing the logic to generate a text-based histogram based on item frequencies was challenging. I overcame this by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and experimenting with different approaches until finding the most effective solution.
File I/O: Handling file input/output operations, including error handling and data formatting, required careful consideration. I referred to documentation and online resources to ensure proper implementation.
Transferable Skills:

Object-Oriented Design: Understanding and implementing classes for encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity.
File Handling: Experience in reading from and writing to files, handling exceptions, and managing file streams.
Algorithmic Thinking: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks and implementing efficient algorithms to solve them.
Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:

Modular Design: The use of classes promotes maintainability and adaptability by encapsulating functionality into reusable components.
Descriptive Comments: Clear and concise comments throughout the code document the purpose and functionality of each component, aiding in readability and maintenance.
Input Validation: Incorporating input validation ensures the program can handle unexpected user inputs gracefully, contributing to its robustness and adaptability.
